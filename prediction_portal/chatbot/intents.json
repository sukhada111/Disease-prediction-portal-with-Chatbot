These can include both overeating and undereating. At times, one can experience out of control eating even after they are full or they can have phases of binge eating and at times people tend to avoid food. Eating disorders are often an outcome of bad mental state and could be fixed by consulting a Nutrition counsellor, undergoing psychotherapy or taking medicines like antidepressants though it is not the best approach.",

There are various fears that are developed during childhood like fear of the dark, fear of barking of dogs, fear of heights and many more. Most are mild, but even when they intensify, they generally subside on their own after a while. Fortunately, most phobias are quite treatable. In general, they are not a sign of serious mental illness requiring many months or years of therapy. However if it persists and intensifies, help from a psychiatrist is recommended. A childhood maltreatment should not be confused with a mild fear.", 
                "Early life adversity is a major risk factor for the development of psychological and behavioural problems later in life. Higher rates of depression, suicidality, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and aggressive behaviour have been reported in adults who experienced childhood maltreatment. It is very important in such cases to open up about the fears and get help either from a therapist or from a loved one to receive the assurance that you have support in case of a breakdown or a tough phase.",

Talking about your issues with a therapist or a psychologist will help you overcome your fears. Childhood issues tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety."
